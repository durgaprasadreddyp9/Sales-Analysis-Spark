# Sales-Analysis-Spark

This project analyzes sales data using Apache Spark (PySpark) to extract key business insights. The dataset consists of sales transactions and menu details, which are used to generate reports on customer spending, product performance, seasonal trends, and geographic sales distribution.

The goal is to demonstrate big data processing using PySpark while implementing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations and aggregations to derive meaningful insights.

Results & Takeaways:

 Identified top spending customers & best-selling products
 Discovered seasonal trends in sales
 Assessed sales performance across locations
